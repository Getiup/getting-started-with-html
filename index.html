  well, why <b>wouldn't</b> I learn to code?
<br>
<br>
<b>Procedural Thinking</b>
<br>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.
<br>
<b>Steps</b>
<br>
<b>1.</b>Blah blah
<br>
<b>2.</b>Blah blah
<br>
<b>3.</b>Blah blah
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract Thinking</b>
<br>Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.
<br><b>1+1=2<br>Orange+Orange=2 Oranges</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Systematic Debugging</b>
<br>Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different
pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree.
<br><b>Problem</b>=Blah blah
<br>
<b>Possible Causes</b>=Blah blah
<br>
<br>
<b>Technological Emphaty</b></b>
<br>"Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.
<br><b>
Understanding how computers see things.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Sytems Thinking</b>
<br> Taking one big idea and breaking it down into its components pieces.
<br>

    <br>
